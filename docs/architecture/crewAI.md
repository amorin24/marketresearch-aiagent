# CrewAI Architecture

## Overview

CrewAI is a framework for orchestrating role-playing autonomous AI agents. It uses a crew-based approach with specialized agents that have specific roles and goals. The framework enables multi-agent collaboration with sequential and parallel task execution.

## Key Components

### 1. Crew
The central organizing structure in CrewAI. A crew consists of multiple agents with different roles and a set of tasks to be executed.

### 2. Agents
Specialized AI agents with defined roles, goals, and tools:
- **Research Agent**: Discovers emerging fintech companies from public sources
- **Data Extraction Agent**: Extracts structured data about companies
- **Analysis Agent**: Analyzes company data and determines relevance

### 3. Tasks
Defined work items assigned to specific agents:
- Search for emerging fintech companies
- Extract company details
- Analyze company relevance

### 4. Tools
Capabilities that agents can use to accomplish their tasks:
- Web search
- News API
- Web scraper
- Data parser
- Data analysis

## Workflow

1. The Research Agent searches for emerging fintech companies using web search and news API tools
2. The Data Extraction Agent extracts structured data from the research results
3. The Analysis Agent analyzes the extracted data and scores companies based on relevance

## Strengths

- Multi-agent collaboration with specialized roles
- Sequential and parallel task execution
- Memory and context sharing between agents
- Role-based agent specialization

## Limitations

- Requires OpenAI API key
- Limited to text-based data sources
